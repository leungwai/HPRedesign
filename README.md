# üé® HPRedesign

_\#HTML \#CSS \#Bootstrap_

Project from Intro to Web Dev class that redesigns the HP webpage (c. 2021) that better organizes the layout of HP's laptops for customers. 

## Premise
As HP has more products in its portfolio, including printers, desktops, laptops, and more, and within each product category there is a variety of products geared for different consumers, I thought it would be great to create a dedicated page for all of the HP PCs, and within that page, redesign the "Laptops" tab that highlights the then 4 main series of HP non-gaming laptops. 

## This Project Showcases: 
- üíª Use of **HTML** and **CSS** for page creation and decoration
- üéâ Use of **Bootstrap** for grid alignment for the various panels and posts
- üì± Adaptive to various screen sizes and profiles
- üî® Hero Banner that showcases the latest and greatest, and the "4 quadrants" that showcases HP's 4 main product lines \(in descending order from premium to everday\)
- üñ•Ô∏è Lots of HP computers \(woooo yayayayay\)

## To Improve for V2
- [ ] The current layout of HP's laptops and 2-in-1s page (as of Apr 2024) is much more organized, but still much more overwhelming that it needs to be. I think moving the specific SKUs of laptops to separate pages will serve to make the page less overwhelming for customers, who have to scroll all the way down just to buy a Chromebook.

## Sources and Attributes
- HP for all the images and logo assets
- FontAwesome for all the icons used in the project
